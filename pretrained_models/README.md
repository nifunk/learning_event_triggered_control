Inside this folder are the models, trained using our algorithm, which are presented in the publication.

Inside each of the folders (i.e., Pendulum, HalfCheetah,...) are the models and also another README that provides the commands how to launch the desired models. In addition to the models, we also always provide the src_code folder, which exactly corresponds to the source code which was used to train the respective model.
