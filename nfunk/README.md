As described in the top level readme the folders here contain the following:
* envs_nf contains the implementation of the custom Pendulum envirnoment
* the helper folder and the run.py file are files that are needed as I modified the original baseline implementation
* the LQR folder contains several LQR agents with different triggering conditions as well as a script to calculate the weights of a LQR
