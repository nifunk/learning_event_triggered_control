The files in here represent the implementation of the algorithm in the paper, without any event-triggering involved. Therefore, here we deal with the case where just the two policies are executed without any zero order hold. Thus, there is also no communication penalty involved.

Command to train a model:

```setup
python run_mujoco.py --env HalfCheetah-v2 --seed 0 --app savename --opt 2 --saves --wsaves
```

Command to execute a model:

```setup
python run_visual.py --env=HalfCheetah-v2 --seed=0 --opt=2 --epoch=400 --path=PATH_TO_RESULTS_FOLDER --render=1
```
